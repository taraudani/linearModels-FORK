        "**Q1.** Please answer the following questions in your own words.\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. What makes a model \"linear\"? \"Linear\" in what?**\n",
        "A model is linear because the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is proportional and therefore linear. Changes in the independent variable lead to proportional changes in the dependent variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. How do you interpret the coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable? (This is a trick question, and the trick involves how you handle the intercept of the model.)**\n",
        "Dummy/one-hot-encoding is a method of transforming a catigorical variable into a numerical variable by making it binary with numbers, which allows models to assess and break down categorical variables. If there is an intercept, it means that one of the categories is omitted, and if there is not, then no categories are omitted so each dummy gets a coefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Can linear regression be used for classification? Explain why, or why not.**\n",
        "Linear regression is ideal for continuous variables and numeric values, so classification is not its strong suit. It could be used for classification if the categories are one-hot-encoded to be numeric variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. What are signs that your linear model is over-fitting?**\n",
        "A linear model is overfitting if it performs too highly on the training data and does not generalize well enough on the test data. Additionally, a high R squared value on the training data means it is fitting the noise too well, and will not perform well on the test data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. Clearly explain multi-colinearity using the two-stage least squares technique.**\n",
        "Multi-colinearity is a statistical concept wherein multiple independent variables in a concept are correlated. Two variables are considered perfectly collinear if their correlation coefficient is -1 or 1. The two-stage least squares technique replaces an independent variable that is highly collinear with other variables with an instrument Z that is correlated with the independent variable and not the error term. X is regressed on the instrument Z and the outcome is regressed on the predicted X.\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. How can you incorporate nonlinear relationships between your target/response/dependent/outcome variable $y$ and your features/control/response/independent variables $x$ into your analysis?**\n",
        "Techniques like transforming variables, polynomial regression, or employing nonlinear regression models can be effective in incorporating nonlinear relationships between x and y. These transformations or regressions can help fit the suspected relationship.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is the interpretation of the intercept? A slope coefficient for a variable? The coefficient for a dummy/one-hot-encoded variable?**\n",
        "The intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable y when all the independent variables x are equal to 0. The slope coefficient measures the change in y for a one unit increase in x, holding all other variables constant. The coefficient for a dummy variable represents the difference in y between that category and the reference category.  "

Split the sample 80/20 into a training and a test set and run a regression including that kind of \"property type X neighborhood\" dummy, plus `Review Scores Rating`. How does the slope coefficient for `Review Scores Rating`, the $R^2$, and the RMSE change? Do they increase significantly compares to part 5?

For your best model with expanded features, what is the $R^2$ and `RMSE`? How does it compare to your best model from part 4?\n",

We would like to understand how that outcome is predicted by characteristics of the defendant, particularly race. Let's be very careful/clear: We aren't saying anyone *should* be held without bond or asserting that people with different demographic variables *should* be more likely to be held, but instead trying to predict whether people with different characteristics *are empirically more likely* to be held without bond, given the available information. This is the first step we would take in investigating whether a system is fair, or how large the disparities are: Does it treat people with similar observable characteristics similarly, or not? We are going to look at a common question: Are Black defendants treated differently from white or Asian ones? (There are Native American defendants, but there are 11 in total, which is such a small number of observations that is difficult to clearly say anything about how this group is treated relative to the others.)\n",
